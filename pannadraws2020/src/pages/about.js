        <h1>I paint and draw fantasy creatures, birds and wildlife.</h1>

        <p>Iâ€™m Panna Zsamba, a self-taught watercolour artist based in Dublin, Ireland.</p>

        <p>I have always been an artistic person and entertained myself by doodling ever since I was
          a child, however, my focus hadn't been on art from the beginning. I was born in Hungary, where I first I studied
          English literature and culture at college, though I took freelance web
          development jobs during those years. Graduating from there I became a
          software engineer. In a different way this career fulfilled my creative passion,
         but I couldn't hold in the real itch to create fine art, which burst out in my
         early 30s. I decided then to take my artistic self seriously, and to the next level.</p>

        <div css={style.image} className="first">
          <Image
              img={data.me_at_work.childImageSharp.fluid}
              alt="Panna at work while her boss is supervising the job done"
              caption="Me at work while my boss is supervising the job done"
          />
        </div>

        <p>I mostly use watercolour as my primary medium, though I tend to experiment
          with coloured pencils a lot lately. As a kid I loved comic books, which shows
          in my style. My work is defined by harsh ink outlines and vivid colours I use
          in most paintings, the former inspired by traditional comic book and manga
          inking.</p>

        <div css={style.image} className="second">
          <Image
              img={data.my_workspace.childImageSharp.fluid}
              alt="Panna's workspace, where the magic happens"
              caption="My workspace, where the magic happens"
          />
        </div>

        <p>My choice of subject is usually inspired by folklore and myths, while I also
          love to capture the beauty of animals and wildlife around me, especially birds. I'm
         lucky to have the origins in a country that is so deeply connected to myths, and
         also to live in another place now, where the same can be told. I learnt to open an eye
         to see the fairy magic in the small everyday things. Believe me, it's there!</p>

        <h2>My Statement</h2>

        <p>I work as a fantasy and animal artist because I have always been fascinated by
        the beasts of stories of my childhood and myths in my readings in later life.</p>
        <p>Part of my inspiration comes from novels and stories, but wildlife constantly affects me
        in almost all everyday situations, like a walk to the grocery store, or just
        looking at my bird feeder through the kitchen window.</p>
        <p>I choose watercolour and ink as materials to capture my subjects because these light mediums
          provide a fairy-tale-like atmosphere to my work. This lightness is balanced by the sharp
          outlines of figures, inspired by superhero comic and manga books of my childhood.</p>
        <p>A bird is a symbol of freedom. The supernatural lets you escape reality.
          When painting, my subjects work as a stress relief for me, so I can get lost in the magical world I create.</p>
